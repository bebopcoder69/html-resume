        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated Implementation Specialist with a robust background in sales and customer onboarding. 
                With a track record of driving process improvements and boosting client satisfaction, I am adept at 
                managing complex projects from inception to completion. I thrive on challenges and consistently 
                leverage my skills in client communication and technical support to deliver outstanding results and 
                contribute to organizational success.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also passionate about learning new things and getting out of my comfort zone, both personally 
                and professionally. In my free time I love to travel, meet new people, and explore the outdoors 
                with my fur baby, Ash (my rambunctious great pyrenees/husky mix)!
