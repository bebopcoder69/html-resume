        <h2>Get To Know Me</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I’m a versatile professional with a strong background in sales, 
            customer relationship management, and implementation. Since 2020, 
            I’ve worked in the tech industry at companies like WP Engine, SUSE, 
            Luxury Presence, and Nurp, where I honed my skills in generating new 
            business, driving growth, and delivering exceptional client experiences. 
            I’m adept at using CRMs like HubSpot and Salesforce and have hands-on 
            experience with project management tools like Asana and Jira.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, I’m pivoting to a career in software and web development, 
            with a focus on full-stack development. My goal is to build practical, hands-on 
            skills and create a portfolio of projects that reflect my capabilities, ultimately 
            landing an entry-level development role by the end of 2025. I’m especially interested 
            in transitioning into AI/ML in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work, I’m passionate about learning and enjoy combining theoretical 
            knowledge with real-world application. If you’re looking to connect with someone 
            who thrives on tackling new challenges and is always eager to grow, I’d love to chat!
